Using this as a scratch pad for keeping track of things I want to incorporate

Look at NextJS backend stuff! Also looking at upgrading NextJS in general for this application.

  Long Term Goals:
    - incorporate a database for blog creation
    - backend for processing entries


  Short Term:
    - MVP for blogs
    - custom handlers for various entry types
    - Entries are read by day
      - Loop over sections and format by type using pre-built components
    - Check for any lightweight word processing libraries? Create my own?


  Word processing (backend specifically designed to produce tokens with state objects to be read by the formatter)
    - various state objects
      - letter, word, sentence, paragraph, heading, lists, indentation
    - takes in raw text and looks for things like
    - stores state with style flags?
      - look into how highlighting works and applying styling to the highlighted sections?
    - look into keystroke rebounding (tune to what makes sense)
    - Needs to be extremely fast ot handle a lot of keystrokes

  Blog Output
    - Has a list of dedicated categories which can be read from the word processor
      - font (could be problematic if not every font is pre-loaded? Maybe don't worry about this for a blog, since all the same)
      - bold
      - italic
      - underlined?
      - font size
      - font color
      - background color
    - program in presets (like headings of various size, etc.)
    - Read the stream of tokens and display the correct format
    -displays the formatted html
